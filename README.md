This repository contains the content for the [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es) website, a
list of third party base boxes for the lovely Vagrant virtualisation
tool.

The intent behind placing the code here is that anyone who wants to
update the list can more easily do so simply by sending a pull request.
The previous iteration used a database and a form, which meant I had to
look after the content and invariably forgot or didn't have time.
